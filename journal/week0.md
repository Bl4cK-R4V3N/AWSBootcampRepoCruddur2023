Install CLI

Instructions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

**For windows:**

Download and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit):

https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi

Alternatively, you can run the msiexec command to run the MSI installer.

C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
For various parameters that can be used with msiexec, see msiexec on the Microsoft Docs website. For example, you can use the /qn flag for a silent installation.

C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi /qn
To confirm the installation, open the Start menu, search for cmd to open a command prompt window, and at the command prompt use the aws --version command.

C:\> aws --version
aws-cli/2.10.0 Python/3.11.2 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off

**BILING**

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/account-billing/index.html


**Review your bills and usage**
To open the Billing console and view your usage and charges
Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the Billing console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/.



Creating a Billing Alarm
Create SNS Topic
We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
aws sns create-topic
We'll create a SNS Topic

aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email

aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn TopicARN \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint your@email.com
Check your email and confirm the subscription

Create Alarm
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm
Create an Alarm via AWS CLI
We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier
We are just a json file because --metrics is is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
Create an AWS Budget
aws budgets create-budget

Get your AWS Account ID

aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
Supply your AWS Account ID
Update the json files
This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json




Choose Bills to see details about your current charges.

Choose Payments to see your historical payment transactions.

Choose AWS Cost and Usage Reports to see reports that break down your costs.

For more information about setting up and using AWS Cost and Usage Reports, see the AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide.


**Check that the AWS CLI is working and you are the expected user**

aws sts get-caller-identity
You should see something like this:

{
    "UserId": "AIFBZRJIQN2ONP4ET4EK4",
    "Account": "655602346534",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::655602346534:user/andrewcloudcamp"
}


**Create budget**

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html

Get your AWS Account ID

aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text


Supply your AWS Account ID

Update the json files

This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
