Install CLI

Instructions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

**For windows:**

Download and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit):

https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi

Alternatively, you can run the msiexec command to run the MSI installer.

C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
For various parameters that can be used with msiexec, see msiexec on the Microsoft Docs website. For example, you can use the /qn flag for a silent installation.

C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi /qn
To confirm the installation, open the Start menu, search for cmd to open a command prompt window, and at the command prompt use the aws --version command.

C:\> aws --version
aws-cli/2.10.0 Python/3.11.2 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
